      <P> I have been working with the Briish Museum Samsung Centre for a few weeks and i find it very useful. I have taken photos of myself and taken photos of interesting stuff within the British Museum and have created a collage about what summarises me. I think this has been a great experience. When i arrived at the British museum, it was quite different to how i expected it to be but i think its still good.
      <P> My object from the British Museum is a unique Japanese teapot. And my own objecct was a picture of myself, I chose this object because i believe that i am unique in my own good way. Also i like the teapot because of its designs and patterns 
      <P> I have enjoyed this course at the British Museum because i got to try new stuff i havent learnt about which will be useful in the future.
